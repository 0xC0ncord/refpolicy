	latest policy version available to the kernel-supported version.

1.27.8 2005-10-11
	* Changed selinux_mkload_policy to fall back to the maximum
	policy version supported by libsepol if the kernel policy version
	falls outside of the supported range.

	* Changed getseuserbyname to fall back to the Linux username and
	NULL level if seusers config file doesn't exist unless

	* Moved seusers.conf under $SELINUXTYPE and renamed to seusers.

1.27.6 2005-10-06
	* Added selinux_init_load_policy() function as an even higher level
	interface for the initial policy load by /sbin/init.  This obsoletes
	the load_policy() function in the sysvinit-selinux.patch.

	* Added selinux_mkload_policy() function as a higher level interface
	for loading policy than the security_load_policy() interface.

	* Merged getseuserbyname patch from Dan Walsh.

1.27.1 2005-09-19

	  non-MLS-enabled systems with policies that are otherwise 
	  identical (e.g. same type definitions).
	* Merged get_ordered_context_list_with_level() function from
	  Dan Walsh, and added get_default_context_with_level().
	  This allows MLS level selection for users other than the
	  default level.

	* Added public functions to export context translation to
	users of libselinux (selinux_trans_to_raw_context,
	selinux_raw_to_trans_context).

	* Remove special definition for context_range_set; use
	common code.

1.23.7 2005-04-12

	  rather than assert on a NULL selinux_mnt (i.e. selinuxfs not
	  mounted).

	* Fixed bug in matchpathcon_filespec_destroy.

	  setfiles -c.

1.21.5 2005-01-28
	* Generalized matchpathcon internals, exported more interfaces,

	* Prevent overflow of spec array in matchpathcon.

1.21.3 2005-01-26
	* Fixed several uses of internal functions to avoid relocations.
	* Changed rpm_execcon to check is_selinux_enabled() and fallback to
	  a regular execve if not enabled (or unable to determine due to a lack
