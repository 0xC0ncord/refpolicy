<h1>Status</h1>
<h2>Current Version: 20050615</h2>
<p>
	See <a href="index.php?page=download">download</a> for download
	information.  This release focused on infrastructure, organization, and
	initial design rather than comprehensive policy coverage or security
	improvements.  Currently only the strict policy is supported, with
	targeted policy support planned for the future.
</p>
<p>
	This is a prototype release, not meant to be used on real systems.  It
	is targeted towards developers, to show the direction of the policy's
	development, and to solicit feedback and assistance.
