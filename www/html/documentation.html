<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>Documentation is one of the primary goals of refpolicy. The current release has some documentation available in the form of a <a href="index.php?page=getting-started">getting started</a> guide. There is also <a href="api-docs/index.html">interface documentation</a> generated from the policy source.</p>
