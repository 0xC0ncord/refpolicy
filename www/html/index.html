<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>
The SELinux Reference Policy project (refpolicy) is creating a complete SELinux policy as an alternative to the existing strict and targeted policies available from <a href="http://selinux.sf.net>selinux.sf.net</a>. What will set refpolicy apart?
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Security: refpolicy has a mandate to develop security goals that are clear and rigoursly applied</li>
	<li>Usability: refpolicy will be easier to understand and use.</li>
	<li>Documentation: refpolicy has a structure that makes it possible to create in-depth documentation.
	<li>Flexibility: refpolicy will support source, loadable, and MLS modules with simple configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Refpolicy is under active development, with support and full time development staff from <a href="http://www.tresys.com">Tresys Technology</a>. We are looking for policy developers interested in <a href="contributing.html">contributing</a>.
