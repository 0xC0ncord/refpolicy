To install Reference Policy sources into /etc/selinux/refpolicy/src/policy:

	make install-src

This will back up a pre-existing source policy to the
/etc/selinux/refpolicy/src/policy.bak directory.

After installing the policy sources, the old Make targets have been maintained:

Local policy development:

	make policy

Compile and install the policy:

	make install

Compile, install, and load the policy:

	make load

Filesystem labeling:

	make relabel
	make checklabels
	make restorelabels

See the README for more information on available make targets.
