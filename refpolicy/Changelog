	* Changed xml to have modules encapsulated by layer tags, rather
	  than putting layer="foo" in the module tags.  Also in the future
	  we can put a summary and description for each layer.
	* Added tool to infer interface, module, and layer tags.  This will
	  now list all interfaces, even if they are missing xml docs.
	* Shortened xml tag names.
	* Added macros to declare interfaces and templates.
	* Added interface call trace.
	* Updated all xml documentation for shorter and inferred tags.
	* Doc tool now displays templates in the web pages.
	* Doc tool retains the user's settings in modules.conf and
	  tunables.conf if the files already exist.
	* Modules.conf behavior has been changed to be a list of all
	  available modules, and the user can toggle the module on or
	  off to include the module or not.
	* Added policies:
		fstools (fsck, mkfs, swapon, etc. tools)
		logrotate
		inetd
		kerberos
		nis (ypbind and ypserv)
		ssh (server, client, and agent)
		unconfined
	* Added infrastructure for targeted policy support, only missing
	  transition boolean support.
