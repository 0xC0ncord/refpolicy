	* Add Makefile support for building loadable modules.
	* Add genclassperms.py tool to add require blocks
	  for loadable modules.
	* Change sedoctool to make required modules part of base
	  by default, otherwise make as modules, in modules.conf.
	* Fix segenxml to handle modules with no interfaces.
	* Rename ipsec connect interface for consistency.
	* Add missing parts of unix stream socket connect interface
	  of ipsec.
	* Rename inetd connect interface for consistency.

	* Fix comparison bug in fc_sort.
	* Fix handling of ordered and unordered HTML lists.
	* Corenetwork now supports multiple network interfaces having the
	  same type.
	* Doc tool now creates pages for global Booleans and global tunables.
	* Doc tool now links directly to the interface/template in the
	  module page when it is selected in the interface/template index.
	* Added support for layer summaries.
	* Added policies:

		raid

20050707 (7 Jul 2005)
	* Changed xml to have modules encapsulated by layer tags, rather
	  than putting layer="foo" in the module tags.  Also in the future
	  we can put a summary and description for each layer.
	* Added tool to infer interface, module, and layer tags.  This will
	  now list all interfaces, even if they are missing xml docs.
	* Shortened xml tag names.
	* Added macros to declare interfaces and templates.
	* Added interface call trace.
	* Updated all xml documentation for shorter and inferred tags.
	* Doc tool now displays templates in the web pages.
	* Doc tool retains the user's settings in modules.conf and
	  tunables.conf if the files already exist.
	* Modules.conf behavior has been changed to be a list of all
	  available modules, and the user can specify if the module is
	  built as a loadable module, included in the monolithic policy,
	  or excluded.
	* Added policies:
		fstools (fsck, mkfs, swapon, etc. tools)
		logrotate
		inetd
		kerberos
		nis (ypbind and ypserv)
		ssh (server, client, and agent)
		unconfined
	* Added infrastructure for targeted policy support, only missing
	  transition boolean support.
